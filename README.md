# Introduction
In this report we will see a deep analysis of a supply chain dataset in which we use Python for data cleaning 
and exploratory data analysis, after completing the cleaning and gathering the insights for the audience. I used Dash as an interactive dashboard 
and to be able to show my findings to the audience.
